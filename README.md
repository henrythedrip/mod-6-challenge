## Description
This is a weather application to be able to see a 5 day forecast as well as current weather for any city across the world. It uses the Open Weather Map API to draw this information and displays needed information onto the webpage. Users are able to search for a city and see today, as well as 5 more additional days of weather information. The future dates are the weather at noon in the selected location. This was an assigment for the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp, and you can view the acceptance criteria and user story below. These were the requirements from the class.

## User Story
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

Please search for any city in the world, you will see a list of previously searched cities appear on the left. These cities can be clicked on again to see the weather for those cities. Previous cities are stored in local storage, and pressing the "clear local storage" button will clear previous searches upon refresh.
